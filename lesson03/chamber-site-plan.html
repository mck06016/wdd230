      <h2>Site Name: Chilliwack Chamber of Commerce</h2>
      <p>Chilliwack is a medium sized community in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada. For the title of the site to be both relevant and searchable including the community name and chamber of commerce is essential. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="site-purpose">
      <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this site is to connect businesses in the community with other businesses and customers. This is intended as both a marketing tool and a resource for building businesses in the area. This site will service businesses located in Chilliwack, and the surrounding areas such as Geendale, Vedder, and Rosedale. It will also connect with other chamber of commerce sites in the Fraser Valley as businesses, users, and customers in our area can live and work in more then one community. This site will highlight the benefits that the chamber of commerce can bring to individual businesses and point out the benefits of the Chilliwack area.  </p>

      <h2>Color Schema</h2>
      <a href="https://coolors.co/edf5f5-4b8b66-a5c695-9bc427-64b8e1" target="_blank">Color Palate</a>
      <p>This color palate was created using an image I see everywhere in chilliwack. I do not own the rights to this image as it is the logo of the city of chilliwack, however for this school project it felt most authentic to use something connected with the city. This logo is not used on the Cities Chamber of commerce site, it is used on the municipal website and related services. It is also on all the town's signs. </p>

      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <h3>Gabarito 500 Medium</h3>
      <p>This font will be used for headers and titles on the Commerce Site</p>
      <h3>Roboto 400 Regular</h3>
      <p>This will be the primary text font for the body of information on the site.</p>
      <h3>Roboto 300 Italic</h3>
      <p>This will be used in the body of information to call attention to something. It will also be used in smaller areas of the site where information needs to be highlighted from the rest of the text.</p>

      <p id="contrast">In considering my font selections, I wanted a slightly different font for the headers then for the body. Although size would be different, I find by changing the font a little bit helps distinguish the different parts of a site. I also thought it important that both fonts be San-Serif for readability and modern design. The third font is a possible, I may use it or I may just use italics on Regular 400.</p>
